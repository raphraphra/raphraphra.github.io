FOR GENERAL APP, HOW TO USE COMPONENTS WITH EACHOTHER

// Essentially, jUst import the components here

// Ther main.jsx runs the App.jsx, and everything is good

// Write them like this and it works (this is AIDS)

// nevermind, it does work
// The server is just dumb

// To return multiple things, use a fragment (empty brackets)

// using props parameter, you pass them as html parameters in the return call

// with this logic, you can control whether or not smth gets displayed

COMPONENTS RELATED NOTES

// to import css relevant to only one part, use a module
// import styles from the css file
// then take the relevant class from the styles.
// Okay?

// props to pass data, a parameters essentially

// for debuging, use propTypes for security

HOW TO USE HOOKS

=> useState {
    -> creates an array with a value and a setter func
    -> the setter func can update the value in the DOM
    -> which is impossible otherwise
    -> when you want to update the value, call the setter func
    -> that's pretty much it.
}
